🎯 Changes Made to Fix Auction Winner and Solver Names
======================================================

## Problem
- Aave (Solver B) was winning even though it had lower APY (12.1%) than Morpho (13.2%)
- Solver names were not clearly shown as Bob, Charlie, and Eve

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Strategy Detection (intent_parser_agent.py)
- Made strategy detection more flexible to catch "highest APY" even when followed by other words
- Changed default strategy for supply/lend/deposit/stake actions from BALANCED to HIGHEST_APY
- Now detects:
  - "highest" + ("apy" OR "return" OR "yield") → HIGHEST_APY
  - Default for supply actions → HIGHEST_APY
  
### 2. Updated Solver Names (AuctionPanel.tsx)
- Changed display names to clearly show solver identities:
  - 0xSolverA → "👨‍💼 Solver Bob (Morpho)"
  - 0xSolverB → "👨‍💼 Solver Charlie (Aave)"
  - 0xSolverC → "👨‍💼 Solver Eve (Unqualified)"

## Results
✅ Morpho (Solver Bob) now wins with HIGHEST_APY strategy (13.2% > 12.1%)
✅ Solver names clearly displayed as Bob, Charlie, Eve
✅ Strategy detection works for:
   - "Supply 500 USDC on Morpho with highest APY" → HIGHEST_APY
   - "Supply 500 USDC on Morpho" → HIGHEST_APY (default)

## Test Command
curl -s "http://localhost:8787/submit-intent?nl=Supply%20500%20USDC%20on%20Morpho&user=0xAlice" \
  | python3 -c "import sys, json; data = json.load(sys.stdin); \
    winner = data['auction']['winner']; \
    print('Winner:', winner['solver']); \
    print('Protocol:', winner['plan']['protocol']); \
    print('APY:', winner['claimed_apy_bps10']/10, '%')"

Expected Output:
Winner: 0xSolverA
Protocol: morpho
APY: 13.2 %
